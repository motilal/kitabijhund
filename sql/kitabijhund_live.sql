(54, 61, 'Inflation', 'inflation', '<p>Inflation is the rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services is rising and, consequently, the&nbsp;purchasing power&nbsp;of currency is falling. Inflation occurs due to an imbalance between demand and supply of money, changes in production and distribution cost or increase in taxes on products.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When economy experiences inflation, i.e. when the price level of goods and services rises, the value of currency reduces. Two important types of inflation are:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li><strong>Demand Pull inflation:&nbsp;</strong>This occurs when demand increases at a faster rate than supply. Demand pull inflation will typically occur when the economy is growing faster than the&nbsp;long run trend rate of growth. If demand exceeds supply, firms will respond by increasing the prices.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Cost push inflation:</strong>&nbsp;This occurs when there is an increase in the cost of production for firms causing increase in price of products. Cost of pro&shy;duction may rise due to an increase in the prices of raw materials, wages, etc. Often trade unions are blamed for wage rise since wage rate is not completely market-determined. Higher wage means high cost of production. Prices of commodities are thereby increased.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h2>Hyper Inflation</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Hyperinflation is extremely rapid or out of control inflation. In hyper-inflation value of money falls so rapidly that people start losing faith in the currency and policy makers thin in terms of switching over an alternative currency.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Galloping Inflation</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>When inflation rises to ten percent or greater. Money loses value so fast that business and employee income can&#39;t keep up with costs and prices.&nbsp;Foreign investors&nbsp;avoid the country, depriving it of needed&nbsp;capital.

It is used to measure the rate of inflation in the country on a point to point basis which means rate of inflation during a certain week ending this year to the corresponding week ending last year. This is done on the basis of wholesale price of 435 commodities collected from major wholesale markets in the country on a weekly basis. The base year for WPI is 2000-01.</li>\r\n	<li>Cost Price Index (CPI): It is used to measure the cost of living of a common man on the basis of retail prices collected every month for 260 commodities which also includes some services.

It is a small organ made up of several pairs of&nbsp;muscles&nbsp;covered in a thin skin-like layer. The outside of the tongue contains many rough papillae for gripping food as it is moved by the tongue&rsquo;s muscles. The taste buds on the surface of the tongue detect taste molecules in food and connect to nerves in the tongue to send taste information to the brain. The tongue also helps to push food toward the posterior part of the mouth for swallowing.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Salivary Glands:</strong>&nbsp;Surrounding the mouth are 3 sets of salivary glands. The salivary glands are accessory organs that produce a watery secretion known as saliva.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h2>THROAT</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Throat is also called the pharynx, the throat is the next destination for food you&#39;ve eaten. From here, food travels to the&nbsp;esophagus or swallowing tube.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>ESOPHAGUS</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The&nbsp;esophagus&nbsp;is a muscular tube connecting the pharynx to the stomach. It carries swallowed masses of chewed food along its length. At the inferior end of the esophagus is a muscular ring called the lower esophageal sphincter or cardiac sphincter. The function of this sphincter is to close of the end of the esophagus and trap food in the stomach.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>STOMACH</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The stomach stores swallowed food and liquid, mixes the food and liquid with digestive juice it produces, and slowly empties its contents, called chyme, into the small intestine. The muscle of the upper part of the stomach relaxes to accept large volumes of swallowed material from the esophagus. The muscle of the lower part of the stomach mixes the food and liquid with digestive juice.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>SMALL INTESTINE</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The&nbsp;small intestine&nbsp;is a long, thin tube about 1 inch in diameter and about 10 feet long that is part of the&nbsp;lower gastrointestinal tract. It is located just inferior to the stomach and takes up most of the space in the abdominal cavity. The entire small intestine is coiled like a hose and the inside surface is full of many ridges and folds. These folds are used to maximize the digestion of food and absorption of nutrients. By the time food leaves the small intestine, around 90% of all nutrients have been extracted from the food that entered it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is made up of three segments, the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum, the small intestine is a long tube loosely coiled in the&nbsp;abdomen&nbsp;(spread out, it would be more than 20 feet long). The small intestine continues the process of breaking down food by using enzymes released by the&nbsp;pancreas&nbsp;and bile from the&nbsp;liver. Bile is a compound that aids in the digestion of fat and eliminates waste products from the&nbsp;blood. Peristalsis is also at work in this organ, moving food through and mixing it up with digestive secretions. The duodenum is largely responsible for continuing the process of breaking down food, with the jejunum and ileum being mainly responsible for the absorption of&nbsp;nutrients into the bloodstream.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>LARGE INTESTINE</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Large intestine also known as COLON, the waste products of the digestive process include undigested parts of food and older cells from the GI tract lining. Muscles push these waste products into the large intestine. The large intestine absorbs water and any remaining nutrients and changes the waste from liquid into stool.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>RECTUM</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The rectum (Latin for &quot;straight&quot;) is an 8-inch chamber that connects the colon to the&nbsp;anus. It is the rectum&#39;s job to receive stool from the colon and to hold the stool until evacuation happens. When anything (gas or stool) comes into the rectum, sensors send a message to the&nbsp;brain. The&nbsp;brain&nbsp;then decides if the rectal contents can be released or not. If they can, the sphincters (muscles) relax and the rectum contracts, expelling its contents. If the contents cannot be expelled, the sphincters contract and the rectum accommodates, so that the sensation temporarily goes away.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>ANUS</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The anus is the last part of the digestive tract. It consists of the pelvic floor muscles and the two anal sphincters (internal and external muscles). The lining of the upper anus is specialized to detect rectal contents. It lets us know whether the contents are liquid, gas, or solid. The pelvic floor muscle creates an angle between the rectum and the anus that stops stool from coming out when it is not supposed to. The anal sphincters provide fine control of stool. The internal sphincter keeps us from going to the bathroom when we are asleep, or otherwise unaware of the presence of stool. When we get an urge to go to the bathroom, we rely on our external sphincter to keep the stool in until we can get to the toilet.</p>', ''),

The bronchioles then divide into small air sacs termed as&nbsp;alveoli.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Alveoli</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The alveoli are minute sacs of air whose walls are so thin that their walls are single celled. These provide a crossing point for the respiratory gases to get diffused in and out of the blood stream, as the air sacs that consist of respiratory gases are in touching base with the stream of blood vessels.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Lungs</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The lungs are a pair of conical hollow organs, the right one being larger than the left one. The lower surfaces of the lungs are concave to accommodate the diaphragm which divides the body cavity into the thoracic and abdominal cavities. The lungs are enclosed in a double layered membrane called pleura. The lungs are well protected in the body case consisting of the breast bone on the front (ventral side) and the ribs on the sides (lateral sides) and the vertebral column on the back (dorsal side).</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Mechanism of Breathing</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>There are two main steps in breathing: Inspiration and Expiration</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li><strong>Mechanism of Inspiration:</strong>&nbsp;It&nbsp;is the process of breathing in, by which air is brought into the lungs. During inspiration the intercostal muscles in between the ribs pull them upwards and outward. The muscular diaphragm contracts and flattens. Because of these movements of the ribs and diaphragm the chest expands and the volume of the thoracic cavity is increased. The simultaneous expansion of the pleural cavities surrounding the lungs creates a partial vacuum. The result is the rushing in of external air through the trachea into the lungs. The process of inspiration is also called inhalation.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Mechanism of Expiration:</strong>&nbsp;The expelling of air or exhalation from the lungs takes place when the size and pressure of the thoracic cavity are reduced. During this process the ribs are lowered by the intercostal muscles and the diaphragm becomes raised to resume its original position. As a result of these movements the size of the thoracic cavity is reduced and the lungs become compressed. The pressure in the lungs is higher than the atmospheric pressure and air rushes out of the lungs through the trachea and nose. Even after maximum forced exhalation, some air always remains in the lungs. This is called residual volume. The maximum volume of inspirable air is called inspiratory capacity. ital capacity is the amount of air that can be forcibly exhaled after a maximum inspiration. Vital capacity is the amount of air that can be forcibly exhaled after a maximum inspiration. Vital capacity is taken as the measurement of pulmonary (lung) function. The volume of air normally inhaled which is equal to the volume of exhaled air, is called tidal volume.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h2>Gaseous exchange in the Lungs</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The movement of air in and out of the lungs and the distribution of air within the lungs are referred to as ventilation of lungs is referred to as ventilation of lungs. The exchange of oxygen (O2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) between alveolar air and lung capillaries, takes place by simple diffusion. The diffusion of gases is caused due to the differential partial pressure of the respiratory gases. Gases move from a high pressure area to a low partial pressure area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Venous blood enters the lung capillaries carrying oxygen at a pressure of 40 mm (at rest) and carbon dioxide at a pressure of 46 mm. The oxygen pressure of the alveolar air is 100 mm and the carbon dioxide pressure is 40 mm. Therefore oxygen passes from the alveolar air into blood and carbon dioxide from blood to air sacs. Arterial blood leaves the lungs, carrying oxygen at a pressure of 100mm and carbon dioxide at a pressure of 40mm. The average tissue fluid pressure of oxygen is 40 mm and carbon dioxide 46 mm. Therefore, oxygen passes from the blood to tissue fluid and carbon dioxide from tissue fluid into blood.</p>', ''),

Veins serve a critical function within our bodies. When blood has been pumped by the heart to various parts of the body, it must return back to the heart. In a metaphorical sense, veins are the return portion of a round-trip plane ticket. The veins serve the purpose of delivering the blood, now bluish in color, back to the right atrium (chamber) of our heart. In the heart, blood will collect more oxygen and prepare to be pumped back out through arteries. &nbsp;The largest vein in the body is called the&nbsp;<strong>vena</strong>&nbsp;cava.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Arteries</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The blood from the heart is carried through the body by a&nbsp;complex&nbsp;network of blood vessels. Arteries take blood away from the heart. The main artery is the aorta that branches into other major arteries, which take blood to different limbs and organs. These major arteries include the carotid artery, which takes blood to the brain; the brachial arteries, which take blood to the arms; and the thoracic artery, which takes blood to the thorax and then into the hepatic,&nbsp;renal, and gastric arteries for the liver, kidneys, and stomach, respectively. The iliac artery takes blood to the lower limbs. The major arteries diverge into minor arteries, and then into smaller vessels called arterioles, to reach more deeply into the muscles and organs of the body.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Heart</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The heart is a muscular organ about the size of a closed fist that functions as the body&rsquo;s circulatory pump. Heart weighs about 10 - 12 ounces (or 280 - 340 grams) in man, and 8 -10 ounces (or 230 - 280 grams) in woman. In an adult, the heart beats at an average of 60-80 times per minute. It takes in deoxygenated blood through the veins and delivers it to the lungs for oxygenation before pumping it into the various arteries (which provide oxygen and nutrients to body tissues by transporting the blood throughout the body). The heart is located in the thoracic cavity medial to the lungs and posterior to the sternum.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Parts of heart and their function</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Pericardium:</strong>&nbsp;This is a fibrous covering that wraps around the heart and holds it in place. This special membrane also contains a fluid which lubricates the heart in the pericardial space or cavity to prevent friction. The pericardium has two layers, consisting of a visceral layer directly coving the heart and a parietal layer, which forms a sac containing the fluid in the pericardial cavity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Heart Wall:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Epicardium: It is&nbsp;the outermost layer of the heart, is a thin layer of membrane that lubricates and protects the outside portion of the heart.</li>\r\n	<li>Myocardium: It is the muscular layer of the heart wall, consists of the muscle tissue. It consists of the majority of the thickness of the heart and is responsible for the pumping action of the heart.</li>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;Endocardium: It is the simple squamous endothelium layer that lines the inside of the heart.

They are the receiving chambers of the blood, which is delivered to the heart by the large veins.&nbsp;<strong>Ventricles</strong>&nbsp;are the larger, more muscular pumping chambers that push blood out to the circulation. They are connected to large arteries that carry blood to the circulation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The right atrium and the right ventricle are smaller than the corresponding chambers on the left. They have less muscle in their walls compared to the left side of the heart. The difference in size is related to their functions. Blood from the right side of the heart goes to the pulmonary circulation while blood from the left chambers is pumped to the rest of the body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Valves</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>These are fibrous tissue flaps found between the cardiac chambers and within the veins. They serve as gates that ensure one-way flow and prevent the backflow of blood.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li><strong>&nbsp;Atrioventricular valves</strong>&nbsp;are found between each atrium and ventricle. The valve between the right atrium and ventricle is the tricuspid valve, while that found between the left atrium and ventricle is called the mitral valve.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Semilunar valves</strong>&nbsp;are found between the ventricles and the large arteries.

The blood in the lungs returns to the heart through the&nbsp;Pulmonary veins. From the pulmonary veins, blood enters the heart again in the left atrium.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The left atrium contracts to pump blood through the bicuspid (mitral) valve into the left ventricle. The left ventricle pumps blood through the aortic semilunar valve into the aorta. From the aorta, blood enters into systemic circulation throughout the body tissues until it returns to the heart via the vena cava and the cycle repeats.</p>', ''),

They are a pair of organs located in the back of the abdomen. Each kidney is about 4 or 5 inches long -- about the size of a fist. The kidneys&#39; functions are to filter the blood. All the blood in our bodies passes through the kidneys several times a day. The kidneys remove wastes, control the body&#39;s fluid balance, and regulate the balance of electrolytes. As the kidneys filter blood, they create urine, which collects in the kidneys&#39; pelvis funnel-shaped structures that drain down tubes called ureters to the bladder. Each kidney contains around a million units called nephrons, each of which is a microscopic filter for blood. It&#39;s possible to lose as much as 90% of kidney function without experiencing any symptoms or problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Ureters</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The&nbsp;ureter&nbsp;is a tube that carries urine from the kidney to the urinary bladder. There are two ureters, one attached to each kidney. The upper half of the ureter is located in the abdomen and the lower half is located in the pelvic area.&nbsp; The ureter is about 10 to 12 inches long in the average adult. The tube has thick walls composed of a fibrous, a muscular, and a mucus coat, which are able to contract.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Urinary bladder</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The&nbsp;urinary bladder&nbsp;is a hollow muscular organ that collects urine&nbsp;from the kidneys before disposal by urination.

It is this canal, through which the transfer of excretory fluids occurs, that is ultimately emptied out of the body. The length of urethra varies greatly in feminine and masculine gender, as in the former, it is much shorter, while in the latter, it is comparatively longer. The body wall is composed of three distinct layers that are continuous with the urinary bladder. As with other organs of the body, urethra is likewise vulnerable to a number of inflammatory, infectious, genetic, and STDs or Sexually Transmitted Diseases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Its length variation is based on gender differences, i.e. in women, it ranges between 3.5 to 4.0 centimetre, while in males, it varies from 15 to 29 centimetres. This is because, in women, it has to travel only a shorter distance to empty into the region between clitoris and vagina and extends from the internal to the external urethral orifice. In case of men, it has to cover comparatively long distance to reach the end of male genital organ, penis.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Function of Urethra</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In women, the urinary tube serves only as a passage for urine from bladder to the region near clitoris and vagina, while in men; it is involved in dual functions that are the transfer of urine out of the body through penile opening as well as the ejaculation of seminal fluid.

Mensuration lasts for the first 3-4 days. During this phase, the inner lining of the uterus is shed which causes the blood vessels to rupture. This is cause of bleeding and is called mensuration. It stops by the age of 45-50 years and is called menopause. The ovary produces one egg in every 28 days therefore mensuration occurs after every 28 days in female.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>STD</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>During process of reproduction, some diseases can be transmitted b/w males and females from infected person to the healthy person.

In fact, the front part of it, commonly called the anterior pituitary, produces the following types of hormones:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li><strong>Growth hormone:</strong>&nbsp;This hormone promotes growth in childhood. For adults, it helps to maintain healthy muscle and bone mass.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Prolactin:</strong>&nbsp;In women, it stimulates milk production. In males, low levels are linked to sexual problems; however, most males make no use of the hormone.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Adrenocorticotropic:</strong>&nbsp;This hormone promotes the production of cortisol, which helps to reduce stress, maintain healthy blood pressure and more.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Thyroid-stimulating hormone:</strong>&nbsp;Just as the name implies, this hormone helps to regulate the body&#39;s thyroid, which is crucial in maintaining a healthy metabolism.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Luteinizing hormone:</strong>&nbsp;In women, this hormone regulates estrogen. In men, it regulates testosterone.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Follicle-stimulating hormone:&nbsp;</strong>Found in both men and women. It stimulates the releasing of eggs in women and helps ensure the normal function of sperm production in men.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>The back part of the pituitary gland is called the posterior pituitary. It produces the following two hormones:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li><em>Oxytocin:</em>&nbsp;This hormone causes pregnant women to start having contractions at the appropriate time and also promotes milk flow in nursing mothers.</li>\r\n	<li><em>Antidiuretic hormone:&nbsp;</em>Commonly referred to as vasopressin, this hormone helps to regulate water balance in the body.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h2>Testes</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Testes are found in men only. This gland produces&nbsp;testosterone, which promotes the growth of the penis as a male gets older as well as facial and body hair. It also deepens the voice of a male at a certain age. Other functions of testosterone include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Maintaining sex drive</li>\r\n	<li>Promoting production of sperm</li>\r\n	<li>Maintaining healthy levels of muscle and bone mass</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h2>Thymus</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>This gland secretes thymosin hormones that are commonly referred to as humoral factors and are important during puberty. The role of these hormones is to make sure a person develops a healthy immune system. This is present behind your sternum and between your lungs, is only active until puberty. After puberty, the&nbsp;thymus&nbsp;starts to slowly shrink and become replaced by fat.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Thyroid</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The thyroid controls a person&#39;s metabolism. It is located in the front of the neck. This gland secretes hormones that govern many of the functions in your body, such as the way the body uses energy, consumes oxygen and produces heat.&nbsp;Thyroid disorder typically occurs when this gland releases too many or too few hormones. An overactive or underactive thyroid can lead to a wide range of health problems.</p>', ''),

There are two type of forces operating insde the nucleus of an atom. These are:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li><strong>Electrostatic Force:&nbsp;</strong>The force which a charged particle exerts on another charged particle is called electrostatic force. The electrostatic force may cause attraction or repulsion depending upon the nature of charges of particle. If two particle have opposite charges then the electrostatic force cause attraction between them but they have similar charges then the electrostatic force will be repulsive.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Nuclear Force:&nbsp;</strong>TThe force with which two protons, two neutrons or a proton and a neutron attract one another in the nucleus is called nuclear force(Strong force)</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Nuclear Fission</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>An atom contains protons and neutrons in its central nucleus. In fission, the nucleus splits, either through radioactive decay or because it has been bombarded by other subatomic particles known as neutrinos. The resulting pieces have less combined mass than the original nucleus, with the missing mass converted into nuclear energy. This process is known as nuclear fission</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Nuclear Fusion</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In nuclear reaction two or more atomic nuclei come very close and then collide at a very high speed and join to form a new nucleus. During this process, matter is not conserved because some of the matter of the fusing nuclei is converted to photons (energy). This process is known as nuclear Fusion</p>', ''),

Each byte of memory is assigned a&nbsp;memory address.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Processor Speed</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Processor speed is measured by the clock rate of a system. It is measured in megahertz (MHz) where:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 MHz = 1 million cycles per second</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1GHz = 1 billion cycles per second.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Physical Components</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>There are several Physical Components of a computer which are directly involved in the processing.

Two types of storage devices are used in computer:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Primary Storage</li>\r\n	<li>Secondary Storage</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h2>Primary Storage</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>It is the main memory of computer which keeps track of what is currently being processed. It is a volatile memory means if power is switched off all the data of primary storage will be erased off. RAM is an example of primary memory.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Secondary Storage</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>It is the auxiliary memory of computer. Data stored in primary memory will never be lost unless we delete them. It is a permanent kind of memory. Examples of Secondary storage are Magnetic disk, Magnetic Tapes, Optical Disks like DVD etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Magnetic Disks</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>They are the most used auxiliary memory. They have large storage capacity, reliable and provide direct access to data. It contains a drive that spins the disk very quickly under a read/write head. All the magnetic disks have a similar format. They are divided into:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Tracks</li>\r\n	<li>Sectors</li>\r\n	<li>Clusters</li>\r\n	<li>Cylinders</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>When a disk is formatted all data of disk is erased and the surface of magnetic disk is checked for physical and magnetic defects. A root directory is created to list where things are of the disk.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Accessing Data in Magnetic Disks</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to access the data, the following four steps are required</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Seek: It moves the head to proper track that is measured as seek time in terms of milliseconds</li>\r\n	<li>Rotate: it rotates the disk under the head to the correct sector that is measured as rotational delay in terms of milliseconds</li>\r\n	<li>Settle: It lowers the head to disk and waits for vibrations from moving to stop. It is measured as settling time in terms of milliseconds.</li>\r\n	<li>Data Transfer: It copies data to main memory and is measured as data transfer rate in terms of Kbps.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h2>Magnetic Tape</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Magnetic tapes are just similar to the VCR tapes in the way of storing data. The speed of data access can be quite slow, however, when the tape is long and whatever desired is not near the start. The magnetic tape is divided into the following formats:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Density: Higher density means more data on shorter tape. It is measured in BPI (Bits per Inch).</li>\r\n	<li>Block: It is divided into logical blocks, one file can take up a number of logical blocks, but it must take up one whole block at least</li>\r\n	<li>Gap: There are two type of blocks gaps one is&nbsp;<strong>Interblock Gap&nbsp;</strong>(It separates logical blocks) and other is&nbsp;<strong>Interrecord Gap&nbsp;</strong>(It is wider and separates the records).</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h2>Optical Disks</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>They are formed of layers and data is arranged in a spiral way which starts from the centre of the disk. These works on the methods of absorb and reflect the light. The absorption and reflection of laser light is read as &lsquo;1&rsquo; or &lsquo;0&rsquo; by the computer. Types of Optical Disks are:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Read Only: CD-ROM (Compact Disk Read Only memory) is the most common type of optical disk. The data in these disks can be read only we cannot erase and rewrite the data in these disks.</li>\r\n	<li>Write Once: The optical disks (CD-R, DVD-R) are well known type of write once disks. We can write data only once in these disks.</li>\r\n	<li>Rewrite: In a rewritable disk we can erase and rewrite the data as many times as we require.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h2>Flash Memory</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>They solid state devices that read and write data electrically, instead of magnetically, these are generally used in Mobile Phones, Digital cameras etc.</p>', ''),

A LAN network might be within a building or an area of less than 1 km. LANs are typically used for single sites where people need to share resources among themselves but not with the rest of the outside world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Take an example of office building where everybody should be able to access files on a central server or want to print a document to one printer. Those tasks should be easy for everybody working in the same office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If a local area network, or LAN, is entirely wireless, it is referred to as a wireless local area network, or WLAN.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Metropolitan Area Network</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>A&nbsp;metropolitan area network, or&nbsp;MAN, consists of a computer network across an entire city, college campus or small region.

Exactly two neighbours for each device. All messages travel through a ring in the same direction (either &quot;clockwise&quot; or &quot;anticlockwise&quot;). A failure in any cable or device breaks the loop and can take down the entire network.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Star Topology:</strong>&nbsp;In this type of topology all the computers are connected to a single hub through a cable. This hub is the central node and all others nodes are connected to the central node.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Tree Topology:</strong>&nbsp;A tree topology joins multiple star topologies together onto a bus.
